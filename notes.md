## Preprocessing Steps ##

* Convert `review.json` to csv

* Randomly sample a number of reviews for studying the dialects
    - sample a number of rows inputing the total row size
    - for each sample, write `review_id`, `business_id`, `text` into a new csv file

* Data Cleaning
    - Remove punctuations from `review_text`
    - lower case all text
